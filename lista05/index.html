      <h2>Exercise 9.1.1</h2>
      <p>
        Consider the vertices $x = (0,0,\cdots,0)$ and $y = (1,1,\cdots,1)$ of the $n$-cube $Q_n$. Describe a maximum collection of edge-disjoint $xy$-paths in $Q_n$ and a minimum vertex cut of $Q_n$ separating $x$ and $y$.

      <h2>Exercise 9.1.8</h2>
      <p>
        Let $G$ be a connected graph which is not complete. Show that $G$ is $k$-connected if and only if any two vertices at distance two are connected by $k$ internally disjoint paths.

      <h2>Exercise 9.1.9</h2>
      <p>
        Consider the following statement, which resembles Mengers Theorem. 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Let $G(x, y)$ be a graph of diameter $d$, where $x$ and $y$ are nonadjacent vertices. Then the maximum number of internally disjoint $xy$-paths of length $d$ or less is equal to the minimum number of vertices whose deletion destroys all $xy$-paths of length $d$ or less.

    <h2>Comments from the monitor's class:</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Hi!
      <br>
      Yesterday I didn't had looked to the exercises before the class session, so I was not able to comment them. So here
      comes a few tips:
      <br>
      - For who likes to use theorems in the solutions, this time it is ok to use any theorem proven in Section 9.1 from the
      book, without proving it in the list. You don't have to prove Menger's theorem to use It. But look also to Theorem 9.2
      and the alternative definition of connectivity in equation (9.4). The only thing a require is that you make clear what
      you are using.
      <br>
      - Exercise 9.1.9 looks to be the hardest one.
      <br>
      - As I said yesterday (and I confirm it now, after seeing the list) in this subject the most important thing is to know
      the definitions very well. Very often it is just a few small steps that solves the problem.
      <br>
      - Use wisely the two equivalent definitions of connectivity, given in equations (9.1) and (9.4). The entire Section 9.1
      from the book can be summarized as stablishing this fact and so the exercises from this list are there to highlight
      this.
      <br>
      Good luck! <br>
